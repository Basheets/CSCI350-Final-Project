# CSCI350-Final-Project
This program was the final project for my CSCI350 class. The assignment called for us to make a small "game" using the F# language. 
I made a small game of chance that would take input from the user and would change the probability of the user winning based on the user's choices.
The game would only allow the user to give input that would be acceptable by the program, anything else would can the program to give a message
and say try again. After asking the questions and recieving the responses, the program would match up the responses to see the chance of winning, then the program would generate 
a random integer and if the integer was higher than the success chance, the player would have won that round. The player could then choose to continue or end the game, 
it would then tell the user how many successfuls rounds they had.
